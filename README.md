Audiobook saves our time which is spent more in reading the text rather than spent in listening the same. In this project, I have created a simple audiobook that can be generated with only few lines of python code.

We can customise voice adjustments like speed, volume and gender specialization (male or female sound).

Libraries used: PyPDF2(https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/)  and pyttsx3(https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/) 

PyPDF2: It is used to extract text and split the PDF.

pyttsx3: Helps to convert text to speech.
